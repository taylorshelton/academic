abstract = "This article provides an overview of the sociospatial processes associated with the massive growth of information technologies over the past 20 years, as well as the intellectual developments that have sought to describe and analyze these processes. While geographers took on a key role in combating notions of the ‘death of distance’ in the 1990s, early research on the geography of the information society failed to create a coherent disciplinary approach. Recent work in geography has, however, created a more unified approach to understanding key sociospatial processes in the information society."
