abstract = "Community geography is a growing subfield that provides a framework for engaged scholarship. We define community geography as a form of research praxis involving academic and public scholars with the goal of co-produced and mutually beneficial knowledge. We identify three areas of scholarship foundational for community geography: geographic research on place, feminist and black geographies, and philosophical pragmatism. Together, these traditions emphasize the value of place- based research that is collaborative, reflexive, and both methodologically and epistemologically flexible. This paper provides five core principles that define community geography. We conclude by outlining challenges that community geographers should prioritize in the future."
