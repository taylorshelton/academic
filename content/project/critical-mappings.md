My primary, ongoing research project focuses on using spatial analysis and data visualization as a means of constructing alternative understandings of urban neighborhoods and socio-spatial inequalities. Bringing together big data and administrative and archival data, this work develops a data-driven and theoretically-informed approach that asks how urban inequality is produced and played out on the landscape. This work seeks to both expand conceptions of social and spatial relations in GIS to include non-Cartesian spatialities, while also challenging the dominant spatial narratives of separateness and isolation that are used to justify and reinforce inequality and exploitation in cities today. Whether through analyzing the everyday mobilities of urban residents via social media data or plotting the patterns of residential property ownership that link the enrichment of affluent white neighborhoods with the production of poverty elsewhere, my research seeks to use spatial analysis and geovisualization as a means of conceptualizing urban space and social inequalities differently, understanding both the manifestations and the root causes of such inequalities.
