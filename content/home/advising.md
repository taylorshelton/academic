__Prospective Students:__

I am currently recruiting two M.S. students for fully-funded assistantships to work under my supervision here at the Department of Geosciences at Georgia State, beginning in either the Spring or Fall of 2021. One assistantship is a full-time research assistantship, while the other is split evenly between a research and teaching assistantship. I am particularly interested in recruiting students who wish to work across the boundaries of critical human geography and GIS, using mapping as a way of thinking about and addressing urban social and environmental inequalities. If youâ€™re interested in working with me on these (or related) topics, please email me with your CV/resume, a brief statement describing your interests, and a sample of your written/cartographic work.
