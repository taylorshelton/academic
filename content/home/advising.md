__Prospective Students:__

I am always interested in speaking with prospective graduate students for our program at GSU Geosciences. I am particularly interested in working with students who wish to work across the boundaries of critical human geography and GIS, using mapping as a way of thinking about and addressing urban social and environmental inequalities. If youâ€™re interested in working with me on these (or related) topics, please email me with your CV/resume, a brief statement describing your interests, and a sample of your written/cartographic work.
