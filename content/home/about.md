# About

My name is Taylor Shelton and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geosciences at Mississippi State University. Prior to joining MSU in 2017, I held appointments as a visiting scholar in the Department of Geography at the University of Kentucky and as a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Urban Innovation at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I earned my BA and MA degrees in geography from the University of Kentucky and my PhD from the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University.

I am a broadly-trained human geographer interested in how urban spaces and social inequalities are represented, reproduced and contested through data. In particular, my work focuses on using mapping and data visualization as a means to understanding (and challenging) urban socio-spatial inequalities, especially in relation to issues of housing and property ownership.
