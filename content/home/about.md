# About
My name is Taylor Shelton and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geosciences at Georgia State University. Broadly trained as a geographer, my work sits at the intersection of critical human geography and GIS. My research focuses on the variety of ways that urban spaces and social inequalities are represented, reproduced and contested through maps and data. I am particularly interested in how mapping and data visualization can be used to develop alternative understandings of urban social and environmental injustices.

Prior to joining Georgia State in 2020, I held appointments at Mississippi State University, the University of Kentucky and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Before that, I earned BA and MA degrees in geography from the University of Kentucky and my PhD from the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University.
