# About

My name is Taylor Shelton and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geosciences at Mississippi State University. Broadly-trained as a human geographer, my work combines critical socio-spatial theory and GIS in order to better understand - and challenge - urban inequalities. In particular, my work focuses on how mapping and data visualization can be used to develop alternative understandings of urban inequality, especially as it relates to questions of housing, segregation and neighborhood change.

Prior to joining Mississippi State in 2017, I held appointments as a visiting scholar in the Department of Geography at the University of Kentucky and as a postdoctoral fellow in the Center for Urban Innovation at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I earned my BA and MA degrees in geography from the University of Kentucky and my PhD from the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University.
