# About
My name is Taylor SheltonÂ and I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Geosciences at Georgia State University. Broadly trained as a geographer, my work sits at the intersection of critical human geography and GIS. My research focuses on the variety of ways that urban spaces and social inequalities are represented, reproduced and contested through maps and data. 

I am particularly interested in using mapping to develop alternative understandings of urban social and environmental injustices, especially as it relates to issues of housing and property ownership. Rather than simply identifying where social problems - like evictions, vacant properties or speculative investments by absentee corporations - are spatially concentrated, my work seeks to map the relational geographies that connect these places where inequality is experienced to the places that produce and benefit from such inequalities. More recently, I have begun applying these same techniques to better understanding the city of Atlanta and its broader metropolitan region, as chronicled on my blog, **[Mapping Atlanta](https://mappingatlanta.org)**.

Prior to joining Georgia State in 2020, I held appointments at Mississippi State University, the University of Kentucky and the Georgia Institute of Technology. Before that, I earned BA and MA degrees in geography from the University of Kentucky and my PhD from the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University.
