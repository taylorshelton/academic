Over the course of my teaching career, I’ve taught a variety of undergraduate and graduate-level courses across both human geography and GIS. At Georgia State, I’ve been responsible for teaching the following courses:

- GEOG2200 Mapping Our World: Introduction to Geospatial Technologies
- GEOG4518/GEOS6518 Digital Cartography
- GEOS8030 Seminar in Cartography: Critical Mappings

Starting in the Fall 2023 semester, I’ll also be teaching GEOS8006 Survey of Geographic Thought, a newly-required course for incoming graduate students in our geography MS program.
